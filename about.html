        <h3>My Definition of a Game</h3>
            <p>
                An activity that has an objective and is governed by rules revolving around that objective.

        <h3>My Favorite Game</h3>
            <p>
                My favorite game is probably Hearts of Iron IV.  I really like this game because of all the possible scenarios 
                that you can play through and how you can formulate and adapt strategies based on how the world around you develops.  
                There are also many challenging achievements that you can get, some of which you are force to fight tooth and nail for.
