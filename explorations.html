        <h3>Explorations</h3>
        <p> This is where reflection on various projects will be housed. </p>

</h2>Board Game</h2>
   <p>The first project we did in our game unit was to create a simple board game.  This was to learn the basic concepts of 
   game design and how to make an enjoyable game.  My group created a simple game in which the goal was to make it to the center of the board.
   The board had 4 levels, each of which surrounded the last, with bridges that the player had to leadn on in order to move to the lower level.  
   The final and fourth level was the goal.  A die was used to determine how much a player moved.  Around the board were various special spaces
   which would give the player an advantage.  Making this game helped me learn how much effort goes into game design.  We had to pay special attention
   to things like how to make the player feel like they're moving closer to their goal and all players had a chance to win.  Balancing where the
   special spaces were also located which made us give it more thought.

<h2>Big-Quiz on Python</h2>
    <p>After going through the tutorial on how to use Pygame to create games using Python, we were given various templates of games to replicate 
        and then alter the games to our liking.  I decided to make a version of “Big-Quiz,” which was a quiz game where the player had to provide 
        the correct answer to the given question in the given time.  After replicating the game, I altered the questions, which were by default 
        various trivia, to be questions about flags, a topic I enjoy.  I also spent time changing the color pallet of the game to one that I 
        preferred to the default one.  This experience gave me much more respect for the people who make computer games.  I don’t think I know 
        anyone who says coding is easy, but the smallest error can screw everything up.  I especially felt this when I attempted to add more 
        questions than the default 4.  I never ended up figuring out how to make the questions work even though as far as I know I did everything 
        to make it work.  Somewhere in the code there is probably a one or two character error that makes it not work.  Finding those microscopic 
        errors in huge files of code must be some of the most tedious work on the planet.
